Card(
  _.slots.footer(
    div(
      cls("flex justify-between items-center"),
      Button(_.variant.brand, _.pill := true)("More Info"),
      Rating()()
    )
  ),
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559209172-0ff8f6d49ff7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten sits patiently between a terracotta pot and decorative grasses."
    )
  )
)(
  width.px(300),
  strong("Mittens"),
  br(),
  "This kitten is as cute as he is playful. Bring him home today!",
  br(),
  small("6 weeks old")
)
```

## Basic Card

Basic cards aren't very exciting, but they can display any content you want them to.

```scala examples
Card()(
  maxWidth.px(300),
  "This is just a basic card. No media, no header, and no footer. Just your content."
)
```

## Card with Header

Headers can be used to display titles and more.
If using SSR, you need to also use the `with-header` attribute to add a header to the card (if not, it is added automatically).

```scala examples
Card(
  _.slots.header(
    div(
      cls("flex justify-between items-center"),
      "Header Title",
      Button(
        _.appearance.plain,
        _.slots.start(Icon(_.name := "gear", _.variant := "solid", _.label := "Settings")())
      )()
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(300),
  "This card has a header. You can put all sorts of things in it!"
)
```

## Card with Footer

Footers can be used to display actions, summaries, or other relevant content.
If using SSR, you need to also use the `with-footer` attribute to add a footer to the card (if not, it is added automatically).

```scala examples
Card(
  _.slots.footer(
    div(
      cls("flex justify-between items-center"),
      Rating()(),
      Button(_.variant.brand)("Preview")
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(300),
  "This card has a footer. You can put all sorts of things in it!"
)
```

## Media

Card media is displayed atop the card and will stretch to fit.
If using SSR, you need to also use the `with-media` attribute to add a media section to the card (if not, it is added automatically).

```scala examples
Card(
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547191783-94d5f8f6d8b1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten walks towards camera on top of pallet."
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(300),
  "This is a kitten, but not just any kitten. This kitten likes walking along pallets."
)
Card(
  _.slots.media(
    videoTag(
      sourceTag(src := "https://uploads.webawesome.com/dog-with-glasses.mp4"),
      p("Your browser doesn't support HTML video")
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(300),
  "This is a kitten, but not just any kitten. This kitten likes walking along pallets."
)
```

## Appearance

Use the `appearance` attribute to change the card's visual appearance.

```scala examples
Card(
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559209172-0ff8f6d49ff7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten sits patiently between a terracotta pot and decorative grasses."
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(200),
  "Outlined (default)"
)
Card(
  _.appearance := "filled outlined",
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559209172-0ff8f6d49ff7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten sits patiently between a terracotta pot and decorative grasses."
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(200),
  "Outlined filled"
)
Card(
  _.appearance := "plain",
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559209172-0ff8f6d49ff7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten sits patiently between a terracotta pot and decorative grasses."
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(200),
  "Plain"
)
Card(
  _.appearance := "filled",
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559209172-0ff8f6d49ff7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten sits patiently between a terracotta pot and decorative grasses."
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(200),
  "Filled"
)
Card(
  _.appearance := "accent",
  _.slots.media(
    img(
      src := "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559209172-0ff8f6d49ff7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
      alt := "A kitten sits patiently between a terracotta pot and decorative grasses."
    )
  )
)(
  maxWidth.px(200),
  "Accent"
)
```
