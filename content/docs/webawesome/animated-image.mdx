## Basic

```scala preview
AnimatedImage(
  _.src := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif",
  _.alt := "Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement"
)()
```

## WEBP Images

Both GIF and WEBP images are supported.

```scala examples
AnimatedImage(
  _.src := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/tie.webp",
  _.alt := "Animation of a shoe being tied"
)()
```

## Setting a Width and Height

To set a custom size, apply a width and/or height to the host element.

```scala examples
AnimatedImage(
  _.src   := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif",
  _.alt   := "Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement",
  _.style := "width: 150px; height: 200px;"
)()
```

## Customizing the Control Box

You can change the appearance and location of the control box by targeting the control-box part in your styles.

```scala examples
div(
  styleTag("""
    .animated-image-custom-control-box::part(control-box) {
      top: auto;
      right: auto;
      bottom: 1rem;
      left: 1rem;
      background-color: deeppink;
      border: none;
      color: pink;
    }
  """),
  AnimatedImage(
    _.src := "https://shoelace.style/assets/images/walk.gif",
    _.alt := "Animation of untied shoes walking on pavement"
  )(
    cls := "animated-image-custom-control-box"
  )
)
```
