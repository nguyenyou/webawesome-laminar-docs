## Basic

```scala preview
Callout(
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-info")())
)(
  "This is a standard callout. You can customize its content and even the icon."
)
```

## Variants

Use the `variant` attribute to set the callout's semantic variant.

```scala preview
Callout(
  _.variant.brand,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-info")())
)(
  strong("This is super informative"),
  br(),
  "You can tell by how pretty the callout is."
)
Callout(
  _.variant.success,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-check")())
)(
  strong("Your changes have been saved"),
  br(),
  "You can safely exit the app now."
)
Callout(
  _.variant.neutral,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "gear")())
)(
  strong("Your settings have been updated"),
  br(),
  "Settings will take effect on next login."
)
Callout(
  _.variant.warning,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "triangle-exclamation")())
)(
  strong("Your session has ended"),
  br(),
  "Please login again to continue."
)
Callout(
  _.variant.danger,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-exclamation")())
)(
  strong("Your account has been deleted"),
  br(),
  "We're very sorry to see you go!"
)
```

## Appearance

Use the `appearance` attribute to change the callout's visual appearance (the default is `outlined filled`).

```scala preview
Callout(
  _.variant.brand,
  _.appearance.accent,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "square-check")())
)(
  "This ",
  strong("accent"),
  " callout draws attention"
)
Callout(
  _.variant.brand,
  _.appearance.filledOutlined,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "fill-drip")())
)(
  "This callout is both ",
  strong("filled"),
  " and ",
  strong("outlined")
)
Callout(
  _.variant.brand,
  _.appearance.filled,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "fill")())
)(
  "This callout is only ",
  strong("filled")
)
Callout(
  _.variant.brand,
  _.appearance.outlined,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "lines-leaning")())
)(
  "Here's an ",
  strong("outlined"),
  " callout"
)
Callout(
  _.variant.brand,
  _.appearance.plain,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "font")())
)(
  "No bells and whistles on this ",
  strong("plain"),
  " callout"
)
```

## Sizes

Use the `size` attribute to change a callout's size.

```scala preview
Callout(
  _.size.large,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-info")())
)(
  "This is meant to be very emphasized."
)
Callout(
  _.size.medium,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-info")())
)(
  "Normal-sized callout."
)
Callout(
  _.size.small,
  _.slots.icon(Icon(_.name := "circle-info")())
)(
  "Just a small tip!"
)
```

## Without Icons

Icons are optional. Simply omit the `icon` slot if you don't want them.

```scala preview
Callout(_.variant.brand)(
  "Nothing fancy here, just a simple callout."
)
```
